# CS300

The problem we were attempting to solve in this class was how to create a method to load, sort, and display a series of classes in alphanumeric order and when searching for a specific class, display the prerequisites alongisde the class itself.

I approcahed the problem on a weekly basis, following the instructions on how to use different data structures. Data structures are important becasue they give us a way to hold information in an ordered manner rather than having them in a jumbled unorganized list. They also allow us to read and store information from external files rather than manually inputting them in one by one.

The hardest roadblock I had with this project was piecing everything together. Zybooks was not intensely helpful so I checked online websites on how they did data structures or how to search files. I also had an issue with the delimiter that I used not correctly parsing through the CSV file given due to extra commas at the end of the words, but that was solved by deleting the vestigial commas.

I'm certainly more aware of how data structures function in general which adds another piece of information on how to code under my belt. The course served as a good refresher as I had not taken a coding class in some time. It was a bit of a crash course but it helped all the same.

The way in which I write my code has not changed much. I've never had much of an issue with readability on a code as my brother insisted I stay clean with how I write as I practiced when I first began coding years ago.
